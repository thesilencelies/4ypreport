  \section{The Initial Project}
  \subsection{Context}
  Producing an AI that can play complex games well is a very difficult task. Several chess playing AI are world famous, and are still defeatable despite the immense computational power given to them. In field, TDgammon (a backgammon playing agent that uses reinforcement learning) made a significant stir when it managed to achieve world class competency, and more recently the paper from Google deep mind that uses the same reinforcement learning structure that plays ATARI games using only recieves the screen as input triggered further interest in the field. And the results are not limited to game playing; the results from the deep mind paper underpin recent work that uses end to end training to produce signifcant performance improvements in visuomotor control, and more generally some robots have to function in adversarial enviroments.
