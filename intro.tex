\section{Introduction}
  %what is this about
This report details the research the author did in the academic year 2015-16 concerning reinforcement learning and it's uses. The initial goal of the project was to develop an AI that would be able to play some form of video game using reinforcement learning and neural networks as function approximators. However, halfway through an potentially more fruitful line of research opened up, and the project was redirected to consider how to develop a reinforcement learning agent that can optimize any given function in a minimum of steps.

The primary results of this research are an exploration of the limits of current technology to parse complex situations and produce meaningful behaviour.
